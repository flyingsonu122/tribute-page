                <p>Abdul Kalam was an Indian aerospace scientist and politician who served as the 11th President of
                    India from
                    2002 to 2007.</p>
                <p>He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's highest
                    civilian
                    honour.</p>
                <p>He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II <br>
                    nuclear tests in
                    1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</p>
                <p>He spent almost four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence
                    Research and
                    Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately
                    involved in
                    India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts.</p>
                <p>He thus came to be known as the <i>Missile Man of India</i> for his work on the development of
                    ballistic
                    missile and launch vehicle technology.</p>
